Usage with deep directory hierarchies.

Go to `a` and find the cube, place a portal there.
cd - to this directory again.
Go to `b`, place a portal in the `button` folder.
Move the turret to the folder where the cube is.
Move the cube to the `button` folder.
Now try to swap the both files again using mv, but without portals 
(you don't have to like it, it's just for comparison).
