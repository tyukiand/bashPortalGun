Infinite loops

This is just a warning.
Be aware of the fact that there are tools that can crash or freeze when
they are started in a directory that contains circular symlinks.

This affects some build tools (for example, Maven just freezes if you
forget a portal in your project folder).

So don't forget to `pClose` everything before starting some tools that
can get lost in the infinite loop.
