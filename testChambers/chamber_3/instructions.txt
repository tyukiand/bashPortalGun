It's a gun, not a land mine.

The commands `pOrange` and `pBlue` actually take
directory pathes as their arguments, so you can
"shoot" a portal wherever you want, you don't
have to `cd` there first.

Take a look at this chamber.
There is a room with a turret inside.
You should not `cd` into the room (there is an
evil target in there). Instead:

$ pOrange room            # open a portal in the room
$ pBlue                   # open a portal here
$ rm \[blue\]/turret      # destroy the turret

It also works with absolute pathes.
