No portals on moving objects!

Open a portal here
Go to 'moving', open another portal there
Now move the whole directory 'moving' to 'moved':
$ mv moving moved
Observe that one of the portals is broken, and the other cannot be removed by 'pClose'.
Use something like
$ find . -name "\[*\]"
to find the broken portals, then remove them manually.
Portals in moving folders are not supported, sorry.
